#UdacityDA_Investigate-tMDB

## The first out of 4 projects for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

### Dataset:
* Movie database

### Scope of the project

* Choosing a dataset
* Inspecting the data
* Cleaning up the dataset
* Create visualisations and generate insights on the clean dataset

### Preliminary conclusions:
#### Which was the most profitable movie? What about the least:
Avatar and The Warrior's Way
#### What year was the most profitable? What about the least (on average)
2015 and 1966
#### What is the best month to release a movie (as in most profitable month) ?
June
#### What are the main correlations between profits and other variables? Popularity, Director, Runtime, Genre, Production Company, Voting Rating? - including visuals. Is there a recipe for success? Based on the correlation findings, can we derive an approach to get a profitable movie?
Popularity and vote counts are the most correlated variables with the profits of a movie. 
Moreover, if we look at the most popular cast members, directors, production companies and genres
an easy recipe for success would be an Adventure movie, starring Johnny Depp, produced under the umbrella of Walt Disney and directed by Steven Spielberg
