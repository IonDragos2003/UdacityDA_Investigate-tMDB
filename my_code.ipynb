    "    8. Can we use machine learning to group the descriptions of the movies, to derive main themes? What about from the title? Are these any kind related?\n",
    "    9. Is there a recipe for a big profit movie? Director + actors + popularity?\n",
    "    10. Does the production company impact the cast? Assuming biggest stars are requiring a higher budget? What about the movie popularity?"
